<p><span>The AAS is hosting its first-ever competition for products created using WorldWide Telescope. Since WWT became part of the .NET Foundation and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aas.org/posts/news/2016/01/worldwide-telescope-has-new-home-aas" target="_blank">joined the AAS family</a><span>, we&rsquo;ve seen it used for some&nbsp;great science communication by&nbsp;authors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz10K7P1G7g">submitting video&nbsp;abstracts for their research articles</a></span><span>, as well as some <a href="http://worldwidetelescope.org/Interact/MilkyWay">spectacular examples of interactive web-based experiences and awesome tours introducing people to astronomy concepts</a></span><span>. The project would love to see what else people can come up with!</span></p>

<p>Entries are now being accepted in any of three categories: <strong>research</strong>, <strong>education</strong>, or <strong>planetarium</strong>.&nbsp;<span>There are prizes for the top three entries in each of the three categories, including Amazon gift cards, telescopes, and iPad minis, and there&rsquo;s an additional prize for the top&nbsp;2017 solar eclipse entry. There&rsquo;s also an overall Grand Prize of an advanced goto mount and refractor telescope generously provided by Explore Scientific.&nbsp;</span>In addition, there will be a special prize for the top WWT tour on information or safety on the upcoming 2017 solar eclipse.</p>
