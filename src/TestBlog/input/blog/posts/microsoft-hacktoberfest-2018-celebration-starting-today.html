<p><a href="https://open.microsoft.com/2018/09/18/hacktoberfest-2018-microsoft/">Microsoft announced</a> a couple weeks ago that they’re participating in this year’s <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>, a month-long celebration of open source software. Launched as a partnership between DigitalOcean and GitHub in 2014, it rallies a global community of contributors, with last year’s event drawing more than 30,000 participants!</p>

<p>This October, Microsoft will recognize anyone who submits a pull request between October 1<sup>st</sup> and 31<sup>st</sup> to one of <a href="https://opensource.microsoft.com/">their open source projects</a> with a special limited-edition T-shirt. This of course includes all of our Microsoft contributed&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/">.NET open source projects</a>. Take a particularly good look at the “up-for-grabs” labeled issues in these repos. The team has labeled the issues this way that are great for our community contributors to work on first.</p>

<p>Code <i>and</i> documentation contributions are welcome. Explore the GitHub repos, find something that interests you, and submit your first (or 100th) pull request.</p>

<p>For information on how to participate and claim your T-shirt, see the <a href="https://open.microsoft.com/">OpenAtMicrosoft blog</a> for details. Make sure you read the contribution rules, including <a href="https://aka.ms/hacktoberfestshirt">filling in the form</a>! If you have questions, post them as issues on the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Hacktoberfest">Hacktoberfest GitHub repo</a> or tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/openatmicrosoft">@@OpenAtMicrosoft</a> with hashtag #hacktoberfest.</p>

<p><br />
Happy Hacktoberfest!</p>
