<p>The .NET team at Microsoft announced today that they are contributing another new open source project to the .NET Foundation -- <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild">the Microsoft Build Engine</a> (MSBuild), available today on <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/msbuild">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>MSBuild is a platform for building applications, and the default build engine for Visual Studio and the .NET community on the Windows platform. It enables developers to orchestrate and build products in environments where Visual Studio isn&rsquo;t installed. Through open sourcing MSBuild, the team intends to make it a top choice for .NET developers on the Linux and Mac platforms.</p>

<p>The team reports that community <a href="http://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/t/compiling-net-core-code-on-linux-os-x/302/3">feedback</a> led them to open source MSBuild, and through the .NET Foundation, they hope to continue this collaboration.</p>

<p><a href="/msbuild">Get involved in MSBuild</a>, and keep the comments flowing on the <a href="http://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/">.NET Foundation Forums</a>.</p>
