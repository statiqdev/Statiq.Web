<h2>Join an Action Group!</h2>

<p>Last month, we <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/05/31/net-foundation-may-2019-update">announced our new Action Groups</a>: a way for .NET Foundation members to join teams and get directly involved in helping the .NET Foundation scale to the next level. Our teams include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Communications</li>
	<li>Corporate Relations</li>
	<li>Marketing</li>
	<li>Membership</li>
	<li>Outreach</li>
	<li>Project Support</li>
	<li>Speakers and Meetups</li>
	<li>Technical Review</li>
</ul>

<p>We've been figuring out logistics and communications as we move to working publicly and with a large team. We've settled on <a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation">GitHub Organizational Teams</a> and will be communicating out to the individual teams over the next few weeks.<br />
<br />

<h2>.NET Foundation Project Updates</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/58/Announcing-DotVVM-and-Business-Pack-2-3-0">DotVVM 2.3 Released</a></h3>

<p>DotVVM 2.3 brings several performance improvements and fixes, including a new API for local redirects and asynchronous loading of GridView.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.thepollyproject.org/2019/06/27/simmy-the-monkey-for-making-chaos/">Simmy - chaos-engineering integrated with Polly</a></h3>

<p>Simmy (<a href="https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Simmy">github</a>; <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.Simmy">nuget</a>) is a new chaos-engineering and fault-injection tool from the Polly team and some <a href="http://elvanydev.com">awesome contributors</a>. Integrating with the Polly resilience project for .NET, Simmy lets you inject chaos into your calls to any third party system. Exceptions, fault code responses, or additional latency can all be injected into calls. Control parameters let you target which calls will be affected and how frequently, and a master on/off switch per call-path lets you turn chaos experiments on and off safely.</p>
