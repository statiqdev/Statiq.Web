<p><a href="https://dotnetconf.net">.NET Conf 2018</a> was our big live stream training event of the year and the biggest .NET Conf we’ve ever done! We had 41 live sessions – 17 in Channel 9 studios and the last day going an all-nighter with 24 hours of sessions on Twitch and Mixer. We also broadcasted the keynote via Amp Live which bought us a lot of new viewers this year. Additionally we partnered the .NET Foundation with the Visual Studio partner program to pull off a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dotnetconf%20%23codeparty&amp;src=typd" originalsrc="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23dotnetconf%20%23codeparty&amp;src=typd" shash="dNuuvBpkaP1yj4iA8mtfv9sZraoHUnzJtsNLn8xa+sjM3Iv7DrHwxUOQH9sWnEOctzx2Mh+JCXvXk9wVmbA63k9Yzg1/B+Au55k51UoAXVp2q4QfmpzdFMjTG+zzGHO+PJwsG96Du5u7T5VrpOObg2D4OaibsvvAh5Hpn+rpY6Y=">virtual attendee party</a> where attendees could win cool prizes like the Surface Go and Xbox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>.NET Foundation Project News</h2>

<h3>DNN:&nbsp;5 Reasons Why We’re Glad to Be Part of the .NET Foundation</h3>

<p>DNN joined the .NET Foundation in November 2017, and <a href="https://www.dnnsoftware.com/community-blog/cid/155629/5-reasons-why-were-glad-to-be-part-of-the-net-foundation">just posted some of the top reasons</a> they're glad they did. Aw, shucks, we love you too!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Iron Python</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://ironpython.net/">IronPython</a> team is getting close to releasing a 2.7.9 final release with a lot of fixes compare to previous releases. Once 2.7.9 has been released, the team will focus mainly on IronPython 3, a release which will be compatible with Python 3.4</p>

<h3>Chemistry Add-In for Word</h3>

<p>The next version of <a href="https://www.chem4word.co.uk/">Chemistry Add-In for Word</a> is close to release!</p>

<p>It will include V8.0.0 of the ChemDoodle Web editor inside a completely new Windows Presentation Foundation interface. This makes it resolution independent, addressing a common bugbear when using it on smaller screen resolutions.</p>

<h3>NUnit</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://nunit.org">NUnit 3.9.0 console and engine</a> were released, featuring stability fixes and changing the handling of appdomain unload errors.</p>

<p>NUnit framework 3.11.0 is just around the corner, so stay tuned! Among many fixes and enhancements, this release will include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>More informative assertion messages</li>
	<li>PlatformAttribute detecting .NET Core</li>
	<li>ValuesAttribute with nullable types</li>
	<li>Async tests detecting and running Windows Forms or WPF message pumps rather than deadlocking</li>
	<li>Support for UWP 10.0 is back via .NET Standard 1.4</li>
</ul>

<p>We are grateful to our many contributors!</p>

<h3>Telerik UI for UWP</h3>

<p>With one of the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/datagrid-calendar-multiday-view-improvements-telerik-ui-for-uwp-r3-2018">latest releases of Telerik UI</a> for UWP MultiDayView support has been introduced for the Calendar, expand and collapse functionality for the groups in the ListView control and many more features and improvements.&nbsp;Our latest official release of Telerik UI for UWP features more options in the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/datagrid-calendar-multiday-view-improvements-telerik-ui-for-uwp-r3-2018">MultiDay view of the Calendar</a>, nested PropertyName support, major bug fixes for the DataGrid and more.</p>

<h3>Orleans 2.1.0 release</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v2.1.0">Orleans 2.1.0&nbsp;release</a> includes a number of performance improvements, the biggest one being the new scheduler, that all add up in our tests to up to 30% throughput increase on the same hardware.</p>

<p>It also brings the support for distributed transaction to what we consider ""release candidate"" quality, with the new Distributed Transaction Manager at its core. We plan to declare transactions production ready in a subsequent release, after another round of testing and improvements.</p>

<p>Lastly, this release includes a new code generation package Microsoft.Orleans.CodeGenerator.MSBuild that can be used as an alternative to <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansCodeGenerator.Build/">Microsoft.Orleans.OrleansCodeGenerator.Build</a>. The new code generator leverages Roslyn Code Analysis functionality to avoid loading application binaries. As a result, it avoid issues caused by clashing dependency versions and multiple versions of the .NET Core SDK.</p>

<p>This release includes no breaking changes and is backward compatible with 2.0.* releases, which allows for in-place upgrade of a running cluster.</p>

<h2>Meetups</h2>

<p>Our .NET Foundation sponsored&nbsp;.NET Meetup Pro groups broke through 200 this month, and many of them are participating in our <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/local-events/">.NET Conf Local Events</a> worldwide.&nbsp;Here are some quick stats:</p>
