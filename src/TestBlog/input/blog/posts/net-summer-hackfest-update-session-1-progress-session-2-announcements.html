<p><p>.NET Summer Hackfest is a .NET Foundation sponsored, community run open source hacking party. We’re almost done with Session 1 and ramping up for Session 2, so here’s some info on what we’ve been up to and how you can get involved.</p><p><strong>Here’s the most important part:</strong> Session 2 runs from August 7 – August 18 and includes two exciting projects: Brighter and DotVVM. It’s open to everyone, from absolute beginners to experienced .NET open source developers. Here’s a great time to get involved with <em>your</em> .NET open source community!</p><h2>Session 1 Progress: Keen IO SDK port to .NET Standard</h2><p>We started with one project for the first session: porting the Keen IO SDK to .NET Standard. <a href="http://keen.io/">Keen IO</a> is a really cool event data platform that’s really developer friendly. At the free level, they give you $20 credit per month, which works out to 2 million streamed events. They also give discounts to OSS projects, and they’ve got open source API libraries for a lot of frameworks.</p><p>The team started with a straightforward porting goal, but I pushed them to include some stretch goals to keep them busy. They’ve made great progress, as you can see from the Kanban board below. </p><p>Some highlights for this project:</p><ul><li>The core SDK, tests, and build have been ported to .NET Standard</li><li>The code is all running on Windows, Ubuntu and MacOS under .NET Core (hooray)</li><li>Cross-platform Continuous Integration is set up on AppVeyor (for Windows) <a href="https://travis-ci.org/baumatron/keen-sdk-net">Travis CI</a> (for Ubuntu and macOS)</li><li>We learned a lot for the projects we’ll be doing in Sessions 2 and 3 (my selfish goal for this project)</li><li>We had a one on one call with <a href="https://twitter.com/terrajobst/">Immo Landwerth</a> to get some advice on some interesting .NET Standard issues</li><li>The Keen IO dev team have been phenomenal hosts!</li><li>Most important for me: we had some great commits from the community around the world, including several pull requests from <a href="https://github.com/Pothulapati">Tarun</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Donistivanov">Don</a></li></ul><p><img src="https://dnfwebsitewusproduction.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Blog/dotnetsummer-keen-kanban-board.png"></p><h2>Session 2 Projects Kicking off Monday, August 7: Brighter and DotVVM</h2><p>If you’ve been keeping an eye on .NET Summer Hackfest but haven’t got involved yet, <strong>now is the time!</strong> We’ve got two established .NET open source projects run by some well known .NET community leaders. Both are planning some local in-person community events as well.</p><h3>DotVVM: An Open Source MVVM framework for Web Apps</h3><p><a href="https://www.dotvvm.com/">DotVVM</a> is an innovative MVVM (model-view-viewmodel) front-end web framework that offers a clean programming model, over 25 built-in controls, and support for both “classic” ASP.NET (OWIN) and ASP.NET Core.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm/blob/master/dotnetSummer.md">what they’ll be working on and how you can get involved</a>.</p><p>Also, if you’re in or near Prague, they’ll be running a <a href="https://www.dotvvm.com/blog/23/NET-Summer-Hackfest-event-in-Prague-with-DotVVM-and-Peachpie-teams-">full day Hackfest event at the Microsoft office in Prague on Friday, August 11</a>.</p><h3>Brighter: A Lightweight Command Processor and Dispatcher</h3><p><a href="https://brightercommand.github.io/Brighter/">Brighter</a> is a Command Processor &amp; Dispatcher implementation that can be used as a lightweight library in other projects. It can be used for implementing <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Ports and Adapters</a> and <a href="https://cqrs.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/cqrs_documents.pdf">CQRS (PDF)</a> architectural styles in .NET. They’ll have some smaller <a href="https://github.com/BrighterCommand/Brighter/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aup_for_grabs">up-for-grabs issues</a> for folks who are getting up to speed as well as some more ambitious work to implement abstractions to facilitate additional middleware such as Redis, Kafka, and Event Store. </p><p>We’ll have some more information on how you can get involved in the Brighter hackfest within the next day.</p><h2>Let’s Do This!</h2><p>This is your open source .NET Community! Now’s a great time to show up and make an impact! </p><p>Beginners, here’s a great chance to get involved and level up your open source .NET skills.</p><p>Community leaders, let’s take this chance to build the development community you want to see.</p></p>
