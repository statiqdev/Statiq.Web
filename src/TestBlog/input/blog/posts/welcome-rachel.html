Happily, Miguel has agreed to stay on the board as one of the two Microsoft representatives alongside Scott Hunter at Microsoft who now has responsibility for the ASP.NET team&nbsp;and the .NET compiler &amp; framework teams. Joining the&nbsp;.NET Foundation Board of Directors is <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelreese/">Rachel Reese</a>. Rachel is a long-time&nbsp;member of the .NET community and a board member of the F# foundation where she has been driving a number of great community activities.</p>

<p>For this post, Martin Woodward interviewed Rachel and <g class="gr_ gr_114 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="114" data-gr-id="114">chatt</g> ed about her experiences to date and what she hopes the .NET Foundation to do in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about yourself. What's your background?</strong></p>

<p>As soon as I learned to solve for x, I started to be interested in Math. I decided early on that I wanted to study Math at <g class="gr_ gr_201 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="201" data-gr-id="201">university</g>. Once there, I started adding in Physics courses as well and, since I was studying at a research university, I began to intern on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Kamiokande">Super Kamiokande project</a>. For my first summer on the project, they handed me &ldquo;<a href="https://jet.com/product/A-Book-on-C-Programming-in-C/b397f965a46f474d828e7c4721bbe925">A Book on C</a>&rdquo; and said that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be useful to the project until I understood how to code. I took a couple programming classes while I was in school, and started playing around with <g class="gr_ gr_173 gr-alert gr_spell gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="173" data-gr-id="173">web sites</g>. Once I&rsquo;d graduated, I was torn on continuing to grad school vs. working for a few <g class="gr_ gr_204 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="204" data-gr-id="204">years,</g> and pursued both simultaneously. I found a job before I finished my applications, with a friend&rsquo;s company who was using Classic ASP with VBScript&hellip; and the rest is history.</p>

<p><strong>Is that when you first became interested in programming?</strong></p>

<p>While I had used programming as a means to an end while in school, I think I first became really interested in programming when I discovered the community, which happened at two major points. First, a supervisor invited me to a user group meeting around the release of .NET 1.0. I became a regular there, and then discovered conferences, forums, several email lists, eventually twitter, hackspaces, co-working, and many other places and events where other devs hung out. It opened a whole new way to learn for me. There&rsquo;s nothing more fun than watching someone demo something cool in which they wholeheartedly believe. Several years later, when I was looking to learn more about F#, I decided to start a functional user group in Vermont, and accidentally happened into an incredible group of very passionate and very diverse programmers. A similar thing happened: my worldview expanded five- or maybe ten-fold over those months, this time with knowledge of functional programming, rather than communities in general.</p>

<p><strong>How do you see the F# Foundation and <g class="gr_ gr_178 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation multiReplace" id="178" data-gr-id="178">the .</g><g class="gr_ gr_181 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="181" data-gr-id="181">NET Foundation</g> working together?</strong></p>

<p>First, I think there needs to be a lot more communication between the two groups &ndash; I know that the F# community in general, and the F# Foundation, specifically, is an especially passionate one with lots of wonderful ideas and I&rsquo;m looking forward to sharing those with a wider .NET community (and vice versa!). Once there&rsquo;s an exchange of ideas, we can potentially start to implement joint programs and initiatives, and more. I&rsquo;m sure there will be some pretty incredible things that happen soon!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What initiatives are you working on (or passionate about) within the .NET Foundation?</strong></p>

<p>Education, training, and ideally inspiring new devs! I feel like the .NET community overall has lost some of the <g class="gr_ gr_197 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="197" data-gr-id="197">momentum</g> that it used to have when I first joined in the early 2000s. That momentum seems to have been coming back since the open sourcing of .NET and one of my main goals <g class="gr_ gr_200 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="200" data-gr-id="200">is</g> to work with the community to drive that onwards. I know that the F# Foundation has been working on several initiatives that I&rsquo;d love to try to expand and rework for a larger .NET crowd, and I think the release of .NET Core is the perfect time to inspire a new generation of .NET devs!</p>

<p><strong>What does the future <g class="gr_ gr_175 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation multiReplace" id="175" data-gr-id="175">of .</g><g class="gr_ gr_179 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="179" data-gr-id="179">NET look</g> like in your dreams?</strong></p>

<p>Open-source, cross-platform, multi-paradigm, with a friendly, diverse, engaged, and passionate community. :D</p>

<p><strong><g class="gr_ gr_183 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="183" data-gr-id="183">Thanks</g> Rachel &ndash; and welcome to the .NET Foundation!</strong></p>
