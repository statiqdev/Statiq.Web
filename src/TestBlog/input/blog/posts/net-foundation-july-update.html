<h2>.NET Foundation Project News</h2>

<h3>Red Hat: Improving .NET Core Kestrel performance using a Linux-specific transport</h3>

<p>The Red Hat team has released a NuGet pagkage that allows you to replace Kestrel’s networking layer with a Linux-specific implementation. Read <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/07/24/improv-net-core-kestrel-performance-linux/">this really interesting blog post </a>that shows how to enable it, then shows&nbsp;and benchmarks&nbsp;against the default out-of-the-box implementations.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cake: v0.29.0 release</h3>

<p>This release of Cake includes a lot of nice features, including the very handy 'exclusive' parameter.&nbsp;When you've executed a series of tasks and it fails on the last one, wouldn't it be nice if you could execute a single task, without requiring all of its dependencies to execute again? Well you're in luck, this just got added into 0.29.0! Beyond retrying failed operations - this can really speed things up while developing and debugging a script.</p>

<p>More details&nbsp;<a href="https://cakebuild.net/blog/2018/07/cake-v0.29.0-released">here</a>.</p>

<h3>xUnit.net: Hello, 2.4!</h3>

<p>This release includes lots of usability-related features, like improved test method display name formatting, support for reporting results to VSTS, and additional command line options for the console runner.</p>
