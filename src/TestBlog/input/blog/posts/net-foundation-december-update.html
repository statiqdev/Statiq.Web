<h2>.NET Foundation Announcements at Microsoft Connect(); 2018</h2>

<h3>.NET Foundation Open Membership</h3>

<p><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/Microsoft-Connect--2018/K120"><img alt="" src="https://dnfwebsitewusproduction.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Blog/connect-dnf.png" style="width: 1067px; height: 597px;" /></a></p>

<p>At the&nbsp;<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/connect-2018/">Microsoft Connect</a>&nbsp;event earlier this month, we made&nbsp;<a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2018/12/04/announcing-net-foundation-open-membership">two pretty big announcements</a>. The first is open membership: we're expanding the .NET Foundation by inviting the entire open source community to take a more active role, to directly guide foundation operations and build the ecosystem. If you've contributed to a .NET Foundation open source project, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/become-a-member">apply to become a voting member today!</a></p>

<p>We're expanding the board from three to seven members, with one single seat appointed by Microsoft and the remaining six elected by the community. Board elections will begin in January 2019, and any person who has contributed to a.NET Foundation open source project is eligible to run for the board and to vote. This new structure will help the .NET Foundation scale with the growing .NET open source ecosystem and allows our entire community to get a lot more involved.</p>

<p>We're going to be posting more information about membership and board elections in early January - watch our <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog">blog </a>and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dotnetfdn">@@dotnetfdn</a> Twitter account for updates.</p>

<h3>.NET Foundation Corporate Sponsor Program</h3>

<p>We also announced that we're expanding our Technical Steering Group to a Corporate Sponsor Program. In addition to our current sponsors – Red Hat, JetBrains, Google, Unity, Microsoft, and Samsung, we are also welcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://content.pivotal.io/blog/you-re-investing-in-net-and-so-are-we-pivotal-is-now-a-corporate-sponsor-of-the-net-foundation">Pivotal</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.telerik.com/blogs/progress-announces-support-visual-studio-2019-net-core-3-net-foundation-more">Progress Telerik</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insight.com/">Insight</a>. Our corporate sponsors will be contributing annual dues, which will both increase the funds available and diversify our funding (rather than relying solely on donations from Microsoft).</p>

<p>Combined, the Open Membership and Corporate Sponsor Program set us up for a really exciting 2019!</p>

<h2>.NET Foundation Project News</h2>

<h3>Cake Version 0.31.0 Release</h3>

<p><a href="https://cakebuild.net/blog/2018/12/cake-v0.31.0-released" target="_blank">Cake version 0.31.0 has been released</a>&nbsp;with new features including improved file globbing, Mono fall back for .NET executables on .NET Core, NuGet improvements and much more.</p>

<h3>Orleans 2.2.0 release</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v2.2.0" target="_blank">Orleans 2.2.0</a>&nbsp;is primarily about bringing support for ACID cross-grain transactions to production-ready quality. This enables scalable distributed transactions, even across disparate non-transactional data stores.<br />
<br />
This release also includes a number of other improvements and fixes, but no breaking changes. It is backward compatible with 2.0.* releases, which allows for in-place upgrade of a running cluster.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Adapter-Release-Notes" target="_blank">Version 3.12 of the NUnit Test adapter has been released</a>. This release adds the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nunit/nunit3-vs-adapter/issues/215" target="_blank">ability to generate results in the NUnit3 XML format</a>&nbsp;and includes a newer version of the NUnit engine.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Ori Ashual for contributions to the docs and Matti Petrelius, Alex (ahoisl), Phillip Carter, Tom PoLáKoSzm, and Oleksandr Liakhevych as well as our maintainers for improvements to the framework and tooling, and especially Mikkel Nylander Bundgaard and Ace Olszowka for their work on the NUnit Analyzers project!</p>
