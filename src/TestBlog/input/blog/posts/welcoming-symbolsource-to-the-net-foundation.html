<p>Today we're happy to announce that SymbolSource is joining the .NET Foundation!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.symbolsource.org/Public">SymbolSource</a> has offered a free service hosting debugging symbols for NuGet packages for years. When they announced earlier this year that they were going to be shutting down due to the costs of running the service earlier this year, we (together with the NuGet team) reached out to see how we could help. NuGet had been planning to launch a limited symbol server service, but in talking with the SymbolSource team we all agreed that there was a need in the developer community for both services - there are some important scenarios that only SymbolServer covered. With SymbolSource under the .NET Foundation, we're able to help support both their efforts to host the service and build a community open source project.</p>
