<p>Today, I'm thrilled to welcome Json.NET to the .NET Foundation!<img alt="Json.NET Logo" src="https://dnfwebsitewusproduction.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/Blog/json_net.png" style="width: 250px; height: 250px; float: right;" /></p>

<p>Json.NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET. It's very well known to .NET developers - with over <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/">164 million NuGet downloads</a>, it's by far the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/stats">most popular community NuGet package</a> and a fundamental part of the .NET open source ecosystem.</p>

<p>Supporting .NET open source projects like Json.NET is a core part of the .NET Foundation's mission. As part of bringing the Json.NET project onboard, we've been able to help support James and team with the Json.NET 12&nbsp;release. A key example is getting the project set up with the<a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2018/07/03/new-community-director-oren-novotny"> .NET Foundation's code signing service</a> and providing a code signing certificate.</p>

<p>You can read more about the Json.NET 12 release on the project's <a href="http://james.newtonking.com/archive/2018/11/27/json-net-12-0-release-1-net-foundation-nuget-and-authenticode-signing-sourcelink-and-more">release announcement post</a>.</p>
