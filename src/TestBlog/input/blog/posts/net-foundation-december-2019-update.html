<p>Here's the December 2019 .NET Foundation update. Every month, we'll give you a quick overview of the .NET Open Source landscape, including top project news, events, community links and more.<br /><br />This month's update includes:</p><ul>	<li>Action Group Update: Outreach Team</li>	<li>.NET Foundation Project Updates</li>	<li>Meetups</li></ul><p>As always, these are available both on our blog and via e-mail:&nbsp;<a href="http://eepurl.com/dhL_qb">Sign up to get the .NET Foundation Update via e-mail</a></p><hr /><p>This is the newsletter of the of the year, the last of the decade (depending if you follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decade" target="_blank">nominally named vs. ordinally named decades</a>), and also the last one I'll be sending out as the .NET Foundation Executive Director, as <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/12/16/welcoming-oren-novotny-as-the-new-executive-director-of-net-foundation-" target="_blank">Oren Novotny will be starting as our next .NET Foundation Executive Director</a>&nbsp;in January.<br /><br />It's been a privilege to serve you for the past few years, and to work directly with .NET open source leaders, contributors, and community members. During that time, I think we've accomplished a lot together:</p><ul>	<li>We've added dozens of projects</li>	<li>We've added a lot of significant services for projects (e.g. code signing), and helped projects behind the scenes day in and out so they can focus on shipping new releases</li>	<li>We've worked to formalize and streamline&nbsp;our project support and application processes</li>	<li>We've built a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/dotnet/" target="_blank">worldwide Meetup network</a> of over 340 groups, and worked with them to put on hundreds of local events like our&nbsp;.NET Conf Local series</li>	<li>We've built out a one-stop-shop <a href="https://presentations.dotnetfoundation.org/" target="_blank">"Event In A Box" site (backed by a&nbsp;GitHub org)</a> to share and build presentation content and workshops together</li>	<li>We fundamentally <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2018/12/04/announcing-net-foundation-open-membership" target="_blank">changed the governance structure of the .NET Foundation</a> to include open membership and a community&nbsp;elected board</li>	<li>We started an Action Group program, under which .NET Foundation members can become more deeply involved in key areas like outreach and&nbsp;technical review</li>	<li>We ran <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/03/28/net-foundation-board-of-directors-election-results" target="_blank">our first open elections</a>, with a huge turnout of amazing candidates</li>	<li>We rolled out corporate sponsor program, <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/09/23/welcoming-aws" target="_blank">most recently welcoming AWS</a>, and with some more sponsors to announce in the new year</li></ul><p>Looking back on the past year, and the past few years I've been in this role, there's a lot to celebrate, as well as a lot of areas for improvement in the future. I'm excited to see Oren, the .NET Foundation board, and the .NET open source community take the .NET Foundation to the next level in this coming year.<br /><br />Signing off,<br />Jon Galloway</p><hr /><h2>Action Group Update: Outreach Team</h2><p>We have set up our next meeting to discuss the results of our Member (and non-member) .NET Developer Survey.
