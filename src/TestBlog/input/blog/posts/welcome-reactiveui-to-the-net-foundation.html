For decades, programmers have had to mold their brains to fit the paradigm of the CPU. When teams rely on hoping that the behavior that emerges from a program is correct, and that reliance is based on nothing more than a programmer's correctness, you can find yourself in a sticky situation.&nbsp; You can try and mitigate the costs of imperative programming with things like unit tests or integration tests, but why mitigate the costs when there's a better way?<p>The ReactiveUI team firmly believes reactive programming is fundamentally a better way to build your applications. Here's a great video that makes the point pretty clearly:<p>

They also have a slack community head on over to <a href="https://reactiveui.net/slack/">reactiveui.net/slack</a><p>We're excited to welcome ReactiveUI join the .NET Foundation. They've got a lot of exciting things planned and we're happy to be part of it!</p>
