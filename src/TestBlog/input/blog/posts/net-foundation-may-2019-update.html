<h2>Foundation Board Update</h2>

<p>Back in March, we&nbsp;<a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/03/28/net-foundation-board-of-directors-election-results">announced the results of the .NET Foundation Board of Directors</a>. You may be wondering what's happened since? It's been a bit quiet.</p>

<p>The board has had three meetings! Talk about results!</p>

<p>Joking aside, it takes time to take a brand new group of distributed folks and mold them into a lean mean directing machine. It's not only taking time to think through vision and roadmaps, but the nitty gritty details of exactly how they will work together across timezones and distance.</p>

<h2>Action Groups</h2>

<p>The board also has set up a set of action groups to focus on some key focus areas. These action groups will be led by board members, joined by&nbsp;<a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/become-a-member">.NET Foundation Members</a>, so this is a great way for you to get involved!</p>

<h3>Marketing</h3>

<p>The main goal of marketing is to create consistent, powerful storytelling in order to increase share of voice and establish .NET Foundation industry relevance. We focus on the marketing efforts for the .NET Foundation itself and .NET in general.</p>

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p>This team focuses on communicating coordinating our regular communications with the .NET Foundation members and broader .NET open source community.</p>

<h3>Corporate Relations</h3>

<p>The Corporate Relations action group is responsible for fostering the relationship between corporate entities and the .NET Foundation. The goal is to make sure that membership to the .NET Foundation is valuable to corporations, and in-turn that corporations participate in the .NET Foundation to the benefit of the entire .NET ecosystem.</p>

<h3>Membership</h3>

<p>This group's goal is to bring on and involve new members.</p>

<h3>Outreach</h3>

<p>The goal of this group is to reach a new, diverse developer base as well as those underserved in the developer community.</p>

<h3>Project Support</h3>

<p>The Project Support action group is responsible for brainstorming and helping to implement the various ways (and services) that the .NET Foundation offers to member projects. The goal is to ensure that member projects are sustainable and well supported. The services that the .NET Foundation offers to member projects should be valuable and appreciated by those projects.</p>

<h3>Speakers and Meetups</h3>

<p>This group is all about making our .NET meetups around the world successful.</p>

<h3>Technical Review</h3>

<p>The goal of the technical review group is to provide an independent viewpoint separate from Microsoft on the technical direction of our projects.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Join an Action Group!</h2>

<p>The board is still working through issues of how to get any and all foundation members involved in these action groups. We want to do as much work as possible in the open with your support, but we're figuring out the logistics. But we're ready to take signups from members who are interested in getting involved and shaping these teams. Ask your questions directly to the board by filing an issue&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/members-discussion/issues">here</a>.<br />

<h2>.NET Foundation Project Updates</h2>

<h3><br />
<a href="http://nunit.org/news/update/nunit/2019/05/14/nunit-3.12.html">NUnit 3.12 Released</a></h3>

<p>Version 3.12 of the NUnit framework was released! This is the release where test projects targeting .NET Framework 2.0 will need to target .NET Framework 3.5. The application or library which the project is testing can still target .NET Framework 2.0, though Microsoft does not support this.<br />
<br />
There are many small improvements in 3.12, and new features include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Apartment and Timeout attributes available to any .NET Standard 2.0-compatible framework</li>
	<li>Type converters used as a fallback when converting test parameters</li>
	<li>A bunch of async-related requests, like support for ValueTask and other custom awaitable types</li>
	<li>A ten-second timeout for work posted to the synchronization context by async STA tests to finish</li>
</ul>

<p>The 'dotnet new nunit' template has also been updated with a better default root namespace and updated project dependencies.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v1.5.8">Orleans 1.5.8</a></h3>

<p>Orleans 1.5.8 is a patch release for people that haven't migrated to 2.x yet. It includes a couple of streaming bug fixes backported from 2.x.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.dnn-connect.org/events/2019">DNN Connect</a></h3>

<p>The annual European-based DNN Conference, DNN-Connect, is happening next week in Switzerland.</p>
