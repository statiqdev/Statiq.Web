<h2>.NET Foundation Project News</h2>

<h3>IdentityServer 2.3 Release and ASP.NET Core Integration&nbsp;</h3>

<p>As recently announced, IdentityServer will be the default authentication and API security solution in ASP.NET Core. The integration will ship shortly after the ASP.NET Core 2.2 release.&nbsp;The basis for this integration is the new version 2.3 of IdentityServer that has been released last week.<br />
<br />
To ensure maximum compatibility with all versions of the .NET Framework, this release has been strong named, and for extra security, both the binaries and the Nuget packages are digitally signed.<br />
<br />
Besides many smaller improvements and bug fixes, the new version now support the so-called “Device Flow” which enables devices without a browser or limited input capabilities (e.g. gaming consoles, hardware devices) to securely connect to APIs.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>DNN Summit</h3>

<p>Training, Speaker, and Session info have been posted to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dnnsummit.org/" target="_blank">DNN Summit</a>&nbsp;site.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>NUnit 3.11.2</h3>

<p>A 3.11.2 hotfix for the NUnit VSTest adapter is available, addressing duplicate categories in Test Explorer. NUnit Visual Studio Test Generator 2.1 was also released. It now generates an NUnit3TestAdapter package reference required by VS 15.9+.<br />
It's been a quieter month with several new features in progress. The contributions are greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
On December 1st, we plan to stop supporting .NET Framework 2.0 in NUnit framework 3.12 and forward. Last-minute comments are welcome at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/3070" target="_blank">https://github.com/nunit/nunit/issues/3070</a>.<br />
