<h3>Polly Integration with ASP.NET Core 2.1</h3>

<p>We are excited to announce that starting with ASP.NET Core 2.1, Polly integrates with the new IHttpClientFactory. The HttpClient factory provides a central location where you can create and manage HttpClient objects, simplifying and enhancing how you use HttpClient in the four following ways.<br />
<br />
It:</p>

<ul>
	<li>allows you to name and configure logical HttpClients. For instance, you may configure a client that is pre-configured to access the GitHub API;</li>
	<li>manages the lifetime of HttpClientMessageHandlers to avoid some of the pitfalls associated with managing HttpClient yourself, such as socket exhaustion;</li>
	<li>provides configurable logging (via ILogger) for all requests and responses performed by clients created with the factory;</li>
	<li>provides a simple API for adding middleware to outgoing calls, be that for logging, authorization, service discovery, or resilience with Polly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Polly team has worked with the Microsoft ASP.NET Core team to release a new extension NuGet package, named Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Polly. This extension helps you easily apply Polly policies to every outgoing call from an HttpClient instance.<br />
<br />
