<p>The increased openness of .NET has sparked widespread interest in the .NET Foundation. As a result, its Board of Directors has decided to extend the timeframe for community feedback on the .NET Foundation Advisory Council to December, 5, 2014.</p>

<p>The Advisory Council will bring unique knowledge and skills to complement our Board to more effectively govern the organization. The community has already helped shape the role of the Foundation &ndash; a new organization that already includes more than 30 projects across the industry, including the initial open source projects from the .NET Framework Core, under its stewardship. An Advisory Council will help bring more practical experience and business acumen to influence key decisions affecting the direction and operation of the Foundation.</p>

<p>If you would be interested to help guide governance of this process, please consider joining the .NET Foundation Advisory Council: join the <a href="http://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/t/advisory-council-proposal/63">discussion on the forum</a>&nbsp;and send Advisory Council nominations to <a href="mailto:contact@@dotnetfoundation.org">contact@@dotnetfoundation.org</a>.</p>

<p>We will continue to look to the community to guide the future of the .NET ecosystem. The .NET Foundation Advisory Council is a great place to make this happen!</p>
