<h2><a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/">.NET Conf 2019</a></h2>

<p>It's a wrap on .NET Conf 2019 (September 23 - 25) and it was the largest one yet! I don't have the exact numbers available, but Javier Lozano, one of the founders of the conference assures me it was significantly larger in attendance than last year. [Note: More info on .NET Conf, including some actual stats, below.]</p>

<p>For those who don't know, .NET Conf is a virtual conference with speakers from all over the planet. If you missed it,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRd04p81Q7p5TtyjCrj9tz1t"><strong>all the sessions are available on YouTube!</strong></a></p>

<p>During the conference, the .NET Foundation announced a proposal to develop a Project Maturity Model, which leads to the next update.</p>

<hr />
<p></p>

<h2>Rethinking the Project Maturity Model🤔</h2>

<p>The .NET Foundation Board engaged with the community and received a ton of feedback both positive, neutral, and negative regarding the proposal mentioned above. The feedback helped us realize that we made a mistake in our approach and need to scrap the proposal and rethink the approach.&nbsp;<a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/09/30/rethinking-project-maturity-as-a-community-process">Find out more in this blog post</a>&nbsp;by Ben Adams, a .NET Foundation board member.</p>

<p>And a big thank you to everyone who commented on the proposal! Your feedback is valuable.</p>

<hr />
<p></p>

<h2>Welcoming AWS as a Corporate Sponsor</h2>

<p>Also at .NET Conf, we annouced that&nbsp;<a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2019/09/23/welcoming-aws">AWS is joining our Corporate Sponsor program</a>! The AWS team talked about why they're joining&nbsp;<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-joins-the-net-foundation/">here</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p></p>

<h2>.NET Core 3.0 Released</h2>

<p>One of the highlights of .NET Conf was the release of .NET Core 3.0. Find out&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-core-3-0">what's new in 3.0 here</a>. This is a major release bump so there will be breaking changes. Even so, I for one am looking forward to upgrading my code to reap&nbsp;<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-core-3-0/">all the performance benefits</a>.</p>

<p>It's an exciting time to be a .NET developer!</p>

<h2>.NET Conf - Stats and Highlights</h2>

<p>As Phil said above, this year's .NET Conf was the biggest yet! How big?</p>

<ul>
	<li>Over 100K total live stream views (up 27% from last year!)</li>
	<li>67K unique viewers</li>
	<li>77 live sessions, including 32 in studio and the rest during a 24 hour community presented all-nighter</li>
</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRd04p81Q7p5TtyjCrj9tz1t">session videos</a>&nbsp;were all recorded and are going up on YouTube. We're still getting the community sessions posted - sorry for the delay, we've got to chop up a single 24 hour, 50GB video into dozens of individual files and get them all uploaded to YouTube. Soon!<br />
<br />
Check out the .NET Conf 2019 Keynote, with tons of demos featuring the brand new .NET Core 3.0:</p>

<h2>.NET Foundation Project Updates</h2>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly">Polly</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/App-vNext/Polly/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#711">Polly version 7.1.1</a>&nbsp;released: bug fix for async retries with&nbsp;<code>.ConfigureAwait(true)</code></p>

<p>The Polly-Contrib community continues to grow, with two new releases:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry">github</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Polly.Contrib.WaitAndRetry">nuget</a>): provides a new jitter strategy for decorrelating retries in highly concurrent scenarios, as well as a range of helper methods for common wait-and-retry scenarios such as exponential backoff. The new jitter strategy offers a smoother distribution (stronger decorrelation) than previous jitter recommendations, combined with a well-defined exponential backoff characteristic. Thanks to&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/george-polevoy">@@george-polevoy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/grant-d">@@grant-d</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/hyrmn">@@hyrmn</a>&nbsp;for making this project a reality!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Polly-Contrib/Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker">Polly.Contrib.AzureFunctions.CircuitBreaker</a></strong>: is a durable, distributed circuit-breaker, implemented in the new&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-entities">Azure Entity Functions (preview)</a>. The distributed circuit-breaker can be consumed from within plain Azure functions and Azure orchestration functions, and is fully stateful and consistent across function invocations and function app scale-out. The circuit-breaker also exposes an external Http api, making it consumable as a general distributed circuit-breaker for apps or components outside functions.

The release also offered a bunch of performance upgrades converting from Tuple to ValueTuple, and using non-reflection based Observables.</p>

<p>We are working on changing the way the Initialization is done within ReactiveUI v11 to make it more obvious to users how it is performed and remove reflection.</p>
